# CURVETOPIA

CURVETOPIA is a project focused on analyzing and regularizing hand-drawn shapes. It has three main features:

## Features

1. **Detecting Symmetry in Hand-Drawn Shapes**
   - This feature detects symmetry in hand-drawn shapes.
   - Here are the example images for this feature:
     ![Symmetry Image 1](symmetry1.png)
     ![Symmetry Image 2](symmetry2.png)

2. **Regularizing Hand-Drawn Shapes**
   - This feature regularizes hand-drawn shapes, transforming them into more standardized forms.
   - Here are the example images for this feature:

     ![Regularization Output](RegularizeOutput.png)


3. **Detecting Hand-Drawn Shapes Using CAN**
   - This feature detects shapes in hand-drawn images using a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).
   - Here is the example image for this feature:
